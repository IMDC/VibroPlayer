REMEMBER:

Include JAsioHost.jar in your Java project.

Make jasiohost.dll available to your project. This can be done in several ways:
Move or copy the library to C:\WINDOWS\system32. 

If you are forking stuff make a new folder and work on it that way. 
You can use Shah's computer to test stuff since the chair is already set up. 
If you are leaving make sure to take out all the power cables and put the device away, 
put the FireStudio in the plastic box, and put the Amp encasing above Shah's desk.

Thanks in advance,

Shah
